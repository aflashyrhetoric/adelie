    <p>A tinkering programmer for eight years, and a web developer for six.</p>
    <p>Around seven years ago, a family friend showed me her website. She said she had got it "done professionally." I saw the site and cringed. It had obnoxious, electric-blue banners and illegible fonts. Things were scrolling and flashing all over the place. In the corner: a stolen, watermarked stock photo. I wasn't a professional, but I knew this wasn't good work.</p>
    <p>I later found out that she had paid nearly one thousand dollars for this broken mess of a site.</p>
    <p>I learned HTML and CSS and decided to redo her site for free. Granted, it was my first website and it wasn't amazing, but it was something.</p>
    <p>She saw the site and smiled when I showed her my version.</p>
    <p><strong>I was hooked.</strong></p>
    <p>Since then, web design and web development have become an obsession. I regularly research best practices, always looking for ways to improve my process. I'd obsess about text editors (Sublime Text all the way!), responsive layouts, front-end frameworks like Vue and full-stack frameworks like Laravel. </p>
    <p>I've learned quite a bit about what a website <em>can be</em>: anything from a personal journal to a public portfolio, a simple online business card to a primary source of income.</p>
    <p>I've also learned that many people tend to compromise for <em>cheap, low quality sites</em>, operating under the impression that a proper website will leave them bankrupt.</p>
    <p><strong>At Adelie, I work to dispel that notion.</strong></p>
    <p>I believe in bold designs that don't sacrifice functionality. I believe that honest conversations are the best way to sift through tons of technical details to create a great final product. So, let's talk. Let's build something great.</p>

    <h4>design & brand management</h4>
    <hr>
    <p> Born and raised in Long Island, New York to small business owners (an interior design & re-upholstery shop), I have developed a real appreciation for the time and effort it takes to making a dent in the community through your work. </p>
    <p>My parents’ hustle, their integrity, and their attention to detail yields more than just beautiful projects/jobs completed but results in the fidelity and support of their clients. Their work has become a grounds to build connections with people and I have always found this very beautiful. </p>
    <p>I studied psychology, art, and [business] ethics and have integrated my knowledge in these three areas to pursue my own small business venture in the form of Adelie’s design & branding services. </p>
    <p>It brings me joy to work with clients that are grinding hard to do what they love! I love meeting new people, hearing new stories, and collaborating with new minds to churn out beautiful things! It is super exciting to be able to play a small part in anyone’s success with my design work. </p>
    <p>When I’m not working on projects, I am seriously contemplating going to the gym, working on some modern calligraphy projects, maintaining my Etsy store, or looking for new DIY projects to try. But mostly, I love making beautiful things and learning new ways to make more beautiful things. </p>
    <p>And yes, sometimes I do make it to the gym… for Zumba. </p>
