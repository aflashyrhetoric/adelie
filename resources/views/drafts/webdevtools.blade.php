Since these tools are so central to our process and process, we'll discuss these tools below. <strong>This information is inherently highly technical, so if you have any questions, feel free to <a href="/contact">contact us.</a></strong></p>

    <h4>Preferred Domain Name Registrar</h4>
    <p>Before anything else, we're happy to say that our preferred domain name registrar is <a href="http://www.namecheap.com">Namecheap.</a> They have amazing service and competitive prices, without scammy upsells. We highly recommend them.</p> 

    <h2>Our Tools</h2>

    <h4>Simple Websites</h4>
    <p>For the simplest pages (static pages) that don't require the ability to update content, we'll likely use Github Pages in combination with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll.</a></p>

    <h4>Dynamic, "Medium-Tier" Websites</h4>
    <p>For so-called "medium-tier" sites that need to be updatable, we'll leverage existing platforms since they offer a cost-efficient starting point. These platforms mainly include WordPress (hosted on <a href="http://www.cloudways.com">Cloudways</a>) and SquareSpace. Using these existing platforms saves development time, which translates directly to a lower cost. Nice!</p>
    <p>For so-called "medium-tier" sites, we'll use a combination of WordPress, SquareSpace, and custom code that we develop in-house. </p>
