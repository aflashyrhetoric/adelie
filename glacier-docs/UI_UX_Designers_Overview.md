## Overview of Glacier
Glacier will be an educational platform with video tutorials and screencasts to help non-technical users:

- gain basic web literacy ("What's a browser?")
- adopt a web-based workflow using modern tooling (How to use Dropbox, Chrome extension ecosystem, productivity tools like Trello)
- learn what's possible with a website (e-commerce, web-applications) 
- explore what other people are doing with their websites / apps
- learn about the specific technologies involved with websites (WordPress, Shopify, Squarespace, and the differences between them)
- learn how to budget for a new web project
- learn about red flags when approaching web developers / agencies
- more.

## About The Project
Simply speaking, Glacier's architecture consists of two parts:

1. **The Front-Facing Interface**. The part that regular users see and interact with in order to access Glacier content.
2. **The Management Interface**: The part that site administrators see and interact with in order to add/manage content for the site. Regular users will NOT see this part of the site.

Currently, we're looking for UI/UX designers to help us conceptualize and build the **Front-Facing Interface**. The back-end system will be designed & built internally.

## Compensation
Pay will be commensurate with experience and performance, with a minimum starting rate of $14/hr for applicants with no relevant experience.

## Timelines
We're aiming to launch the platform as a beta by September 15, 2016.

## Key Terms & Definitions

- **Glacier**: This project *or* the website for this project.
- **Interface**: The arrangement of buttons, forms, media items, etc., that constitutes a "layout" for users to interact with.
- **Page or Webpage**: Refers to a single page on a website. A webpage will be the "container" that "houses" the interface.
- **UI**: User Interface, goes hand-in-hand with UX. Concerned with the tangible / tactile components that users interact with, such as a button. 
- **UX**: User Experience, goes hand-in-hand with UI. Concerned with the abstract, intangible aspects of interaction - the "feel" and "flow" of the website.
- **UI/UX Designer (or just "Designer(s)")**: One who conceptualizes, defines, and builds visual representations of user interfaces with consideration to user experience.
- **Wireframes**: Minimal, colorless, line-based representations of the orientation/scale/arrangement of various components (such as buttons, forms, text) on a page. Wireframes should illustrate function. 
- **Mockup**: Colored, more substantial representations of the interfaces. Proper icons should be used.
- **Prototype**: A live, testable version of an interface.

### Technical Requirements
- All designs should be responsive, but for tablets and desktop screen sizes ONLY at this time.
- Any content not created in-house should be legally sourced. 
- Prototypes will **NOT** be required.
- This project, though significant in raw scope, is not very complex. As such, adherence to strict design methodologies (such as "Material Design") is welcome, but not required.

### Regarding Our Process
- **First and foremost: communication is key**. We won't be able to exhaustively detail our process here. If you don't know something, ask! If we don't know something, we'll ask! For everything else, we'll communicate as we go.

#### With that in mind, here's a broad overview of the project's phases:

**1. Prep Phase**

- Designers will be given a checklist of web pages that need to be created for the Glacier website. 

**2. Work (work work work work) Phase**

- Given this checklist, designers will be tasked with creating appropriate **wireframes** for each page in accordance with UI/UX best practices. 

**3. Critique / Revision Phase**

- Designers will coordinate with the web development team to determine and define new requirements (if/as necessary).

- Iteratively loop through the Work and Analysis Phases until revisions yield a satisfactory end design. 

**4. Design Phase Complete**

- Once the wireframing phase is complete, designers will be given branding guidelines that include branded assets for Adelie. Using these guidelines, designers should prepare mock-up versions of all wireframes and hand them off to the developers for coding.

### Web Page Checklist
This is the checklist of webpages.

#### General Pages
These are general pages that do **NOT** need to be wireframed (they will be designed internally by Adelie staff.)

- **Home**: An index showing available courses.
- **Sign Up**: User signup page.
- **Error Pages**: Pages like the "404" page, etc.

#### Glacier-Specific Pages
These are the pages that are specific to Glacier's functionality. 
These pages **DO** need to be designed and wireframed.

- **Course Page**: Dedicated to a single video "course" with a listing of available videos in that course.
- **Video Page**: The page with the actual video. Shows the current video's place in course. 
- **Dashboard**: Shows user account information, any settings, perhaps course progress, payment information.

#### Potential Future Features/Pages
- **Forum**: We're considering including a simple forum for users to discuss content and build a community. As this is a very significant feature, we're putting it on hold until we have a functional MVP.

## Inspo
Random resources to get you inspired/thinking.

#### Design Inspiration
General design resources. Skim them if you'd like. 

- [The Materialize Library](http://materializecss.com/badges.html). UI/UX Components that adhere to the Material Design spec, as detailed by Google.
- [The Bootstrap Library](http://getbootstrap.com/components/). The popular library of UI/UX components, created and supported by Twitter.
- [Font Awesome Icon Library](http://fontawesome.io/icons/). Icons that can be used freely.
- [Stock Photo Source](allthefreestock.com). Free stock photos!


#### Website Inspiration
If you'd like, review the following websites to get an idea of what Glacier will be **loosely** modeled after. Click around, watch a video or two. Get a feel for the way that content is organized, the way that courses are organized. Take note of any fun UI quirks. This is more for inspiration than source material, so have fun with it.

- [Laracasts](http://www.laracasts.com). Contains screencasts and neatly organizes the videos into different series. Bright colors and cartoon graphics offset the technical content of the videos - makes learning more palatable. Note the website's focus on content. No extraneous fluff, no crappy blog section with outdated content. Take specific note of the course page's organization. Also, note that there is a fun little "XP" feature to "game-ify" the experience of learning.
- [TeamTreehouse](http://www.teamtreehouse.com). A modern educational platform. (Much more complicated than what Glacier is intended to be.) Take note of the modern style and general ease-of-use more than anything else.
- [Lynda](http://lynda.com). Note the more "serious" atmosphere. Oriented toward "serious professionals" like LinkedIn is. (This is NOT what we're going for, since it alienates noobies.)
