## About Adelie
Adelie is a web development, branding, and graphic design agency based on Long Island, NY. For questions regarding web development or the Glacier project, contact Kevin at koh@adelieweb.com. For questions regarding graphic design or branding, contact Yuna at yuna@adelieweb.com.

## Overview of Glacier
Glacier: simply, an educational website with easy-to-understand video tutorials and screencasts to help non-technical users:

- gain basic web literacy ("What's a browser?")
- adopt a web-based workflow using modern tooling (How to use Dropbox, Chrome extension ecosystem, productivity tools like Trello)
- learn what's possible with a website (e-commerce, web-applications) 
- explore what other people are doing with their websites / apps
- learn about the specific technologies involved with websites (WordPress, Shopify, Squarespace, and the differences between them)
- learn how to budget for a new web project
- learn about red flags when approaching web developers / agencies
- more web "stuff"

## About The Project
Very simply speaking, Glacier's architecture consists of two parts:

1. **The Front-Facing Interface**. The part that regular users see and interact with in order to access Glacier content.
2. **The Management Interface**: The part that site administrators see and interact with in order to add/manage content for the site. Regular users will NOT see this part of the site.

Currently, we're looking to subcontract a cooperative, communicative UI/UX designer to help us conceptualize and build the **1) Front-Facing Interface**. The **Management Interface** will be designed & built internally at Adelie.

## Regarding Compensation
Designers will be hired as subcontractors for the duration of the Glacier project. (This is neither a full-time nor part-time position at Adelie itself.) Rather than pay a fixed-fee for the entire project (which frequently ends in disaster), Adelie will offer a minimum starting rate of $12/hr for time spent on the project, with a small downpayment for 5 hours upon the start of the project. This starting rate is offered to applicants with no/minimal relevant experience; Send us examples of past work (or a portfolio) and we'll do our best to provide compensation that is commensurate with experience. 

This phase of the project will require an estimated 18-22 hours of skilled work from the designer, possibly including time spent meeting in-person and making revisions/adjustments. Designers will be trusted to track their own billable hours for tasks and it will be honored within reason.

Terms are mostly set, but we're willing to be negotiable within reason. We can pay through PayPal, Venmo, or via CC through your preferred payment vendor. 

## Timelines
We're aiming to launch the platform by September 15, 2016. To meet this deadline, the wireframes (and possibly mockups) will have to be completed by late June - early July. 

## Key Terms & Definitions
The definitions provided below are provided both for convenience and to help you understand exactly what we mean by certain terms. For further clarification, ask away.

- **"Glacier"**: This project *or* the website for this project.
- **Interface**: The arrangement of buttons, forms, media items, etc., that constitutes a "layout" for users to interact with.
- **Page or Webpage**: Refers to a single page on a website. A webpage will be the "container" that "houses" the interface.
- **UI**: User Interface, goes hand-in-hand with UX. Concerned with the tangible / tactile components that users interact with, such as a button. 
- **UX**: User Experience, goes hand-in-hand with UI. Concerned with the abstract, intangible aspects of interaction - the "feel" and "flow" of the website.
- **UI/UX Designer (or just "Designer(s)")**: One who conceptualizes, defines, and builds visual representations of user interfaces with consideration to user experience.
- **Wireframes**: Minimal, colorless, line-based representations of the orientation/scale/arrangement of various components (such as buttons, forms, text) on a page. Wireframes should illustrate function. 
- **Mockup**: Colored, more substantial representations of the interfaces. Proper icons should be used.
- **Prototype**: A live, testable version of an interface.
- **Graphics**: Non-photographic images, such as those made in Illustrator or Sketch.
- **Photos/Photographs/Pictures**: Photographic images - images taken by a camera.

### Technical Stuff

#### Preferred Software

- We use [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) for design. You will not be required to send us .sketch project files (or AI/PSD files), so you may use whatever software you like.
- We use [Slack](https://slack.com/) and email for communication. Should you join the Glacier team, you'll be invited to the Slack team.
- We use [Trello](https://trello.com) for planning projects, which loosely follows the "Kanban" project management philosophy. Glacier-related Trello boards will soon be made.
- We use [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com) for file sharing and management. 

#### Preferred File Formats

- We love PNG for graphics, wireframes and mockups. We don't like JPG, BMP, TIFFs.
- We love JPG for photographic images. We hate RAW images.
- We love RTF and Markdown (.md) for text. DOCX and TXT are acceptable, but ew. (This project probably won't require text anyway).

#### Design Parameters
- All designs should be [responsive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design), but for tablets and desktop screen sizes ONLY at this time. Wireframes do not need to be "pixel-perfect"; that is, they should illustrate how layouts will adapt responsively, but they do not need to be concerned with specific screen dimensions.
- Glacier's overall design will not necessarily be tied to Adelie's branding.
- Any content not created in-house should be legally sourced. If you'd like to purchase (or license the use of) a stock photo, font-face, etc. for use in this project, submit a simple written request to billing@adelieweb.com and Adelie may be able to cover the cost.
- Prototypes will **NOT** be required, although software like [Zeplin](https://zeplin.io/) may be explored.
- This project, though significant in raw scope, is not very architecturally complex. As such, adherence to strict design methodologies (such as "Material Design") is welcome, but not at all required.

### Project Phases
- **First and foremost: communication is key**. We won't be able to exhaustively detail our process here. If you don't know something, ask! If we don't know something, we'll ask! For everything else, we'll communicate as we go.

#### With that in mind, here's a broad overview of the project's phases:

**1. Prep Phase | Before June 20**

- Designers will be given a checklist of web pages that need to be created for the Glacier website. 

- If you have any preliminary questions, ask away during this time! (via slack or email at koh@adelieweb.com).

**2. Work (work work work work) Phase | Starts June 20** 

- Given this checklist, designers will be tasked with creating appropriate **wireframes** for each page in accordance with UI/UX best practices. We'll require 2 wireframes per page to depict tablet- and desktop-based layouts.

**3. Critique / Revision Phase | Starts July 5**

- Designers will coordinate with the web development team to determine and define new requirements (if/as necessary).

- Iteratively loop through the Work and Analysis Phases until revisions yield a satisfactory end design. 

**4. Design Phase Complete | ~ July 15**

- Once the wireframing phase is complete, designers will be given branding guidelines that include branded assets for Adelie. Using these guidelines, designers should prepare mock-up versions of all wireframes and hand them off to the developers for coding.

### Web Page Checklist
This is the checklist of webpages.

#### General Pages
These are relatively straight-forward pages that do **NOT** need to be wireframed (they will be designed internally by Adelie staff.)

- **Dashboard**: User account page with stuff like settings, payment info, etc.
- **Error Pages**: Pages like the "404" page, etc.

#### Glacier-specific Pages
These are the pages that are specific to Glacier.
These pages **DO** need to be designed and wireframed and eventually mocked up. (More details will be given later.)

- **Home**: A fancy homepage that looks good and displays available "courses." Should link to the other pages (in more than just the navigation bar.) The homepage contains a header and footer.
- **Video Page**: A page showing a single video. 
- **Sign Up**: User signup modal window.
- **Course Page**: A page showing a specific, single video "course" with a listing of available videos in that course.

#### Potential Future Features/Pages
- **Forum**: We're considering including a simple forum for users to discuss content and build a community. As this is a very significant feature, we're putting it on hold until we have a functional MVP. (Does NOT have to be wireframed.)

## Inspo! / Resources
Random resources to get you inspired/thinking.

#### Design Inspiration
General design resources. Skim them if you'd like. 

- [The Materialize Library](http://materializecss.com/badges.html). UI/UX Components that adhere to the Material Design spec, as detailed by Google.
- [The Bootstrap Library](http://getbootstrap.com/components/). The popular library of UI/UX components, created and supported by Twitter.
- [Font Awesome Icon Library](http://fontawesome.io/icons/). Icons that can be used freely.
- [Stock Photo Source](allthefreestock.com). Free stock photos!

#### Website Inspiration
If you'd like, review the following websites to get an idea of what Glacier will be **loosely** modeled after. Click around, watch a video or two. Get a feel for the way that content is organized, the way that courses are organized. Take note of any fun UI quirks. This is more for inspiration than direct source material, so have fun with it.

- [Laracasts](http://www.laracasts.com). Contains screencasts and neatly organizes the videos into different series. Bright colors and cartoon graphics offset the technical content of the videos - makes learning more palatable. Note the website's focus on content. No extraneous fluff, no crappy blog section with outdated content. Take specific note of the course page's organization. Also, note that there is a fun little "XP" feature to "game-ify" the experience of learning.
- [TeamTreehouse](http://www.teamtreehouse.com). A modern educational platform. (Much more complicated than what Glacier is intended to be.) Take note of the modern style and general ease-of-use more than anything else.
- [Lynda](http://lynda.com). Note the more "serious" atmosphere. Oriented toward "serious professionals" like LinkedIn is. (This is NOT what we're going for, since it alienates noobies.)
